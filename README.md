# MUL_my_hunter_2019
 
 Open my_hunter_project.pdf to see the project's instructions.
 
 In this project, we have to make a small game base on the rules of Duck Hunt.
 
 The basics rules for the my_hunter are as follows:
  - the player is a hunter who shoots target.
  - target must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.
  - the player can click on them to shoot them.
  
  For this project, I ask myself : "What or who is the person I want to shoot first ?". Obvusly, I thougth "Hitler".
  So, let's go for a game where we can sniper Adolf Hitler's head in a background of Wagner music !!
  
  USAGE :
  make
  ./my_hunter
